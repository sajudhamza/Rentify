# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Roadmap: From Development to a Professional Live Application

Congratulations on building a fully functional, full-stack application! You have a solid foundation with user authentication, item creation, and editing capabilities. Here is a strategic roadmap with the next steps to transform your project into a professional, scalable, and secure web application ready for a live server.

We can tackle these items one by one. I recommend starting with Frontend Routing and Backend Booking Logic, as they are fundamental to the user experience and the core business function.
Phase 1: Critical Features & User Experience

These features are essential for a modern marketplace and will dramatically improve the user experience.

    1. Frontend Routing with react-router-dom:

        Problem: Currently, your app is a single page where components are swapped. This means you can't share a link to a specific item.

        Solution: Integrate react-router-dom to create distinct, shareable URLs for different pages (e.g., /, /item/:itemId, /profile). This is a standard for professional React applications.

    2. Implement Search & Filtering:

        Problem: The search bar is currently disabled. Users need a way to find specific items.

        Solution:

            Backend: Create a search endpoint (e.g., GET /api/items/search?q=...) that filters items by name or description.

            Frontend: Enable the search bar and connect it to the new endpoint, updating the displayed items in real-time as the user types.

    3. User Profile / Dashboard:

        Problem: Users have no central place to manage their activity.

        Solution: Create a new page (e.g., /profile) where a logged-in user can:

            View and manage all the items they have listed.

            See the items they have booked (rental history).

            Edit their profile information.

    4. Real Image Uploads:

        Problem: Users can only link to images via a URL.

        Solution: Implement a proper file upload system.

            Frontend: Change the image URL input field to a file upload button.

            Backend: Create an endpoint to handle file uploads. The standard practice is to upload the file to a dedicated cloud storage service like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage and save the returned URL in your database.

Phase 2: Core Business Logic (Backend)

This phase focuses on implementing the primary function of a rental app: booking.

    1. Implement the Booking System:

        Problem: Users can see items but can't actually rent them.

        Solution:

            Backend: Create a full set of booking endpoints:

                POST /api/items/{item_id}/bookings: To create a new rental request for a specific date range.

                GET /api/my-bookings: To view bookings a user has made.

                GET /api/my-listings/bookings: To view rental requests for items a user owns.

                PUT /api/bookings/{booking_id}: To approve or deny a rental request.

            Frontend: On the item detail page, replace the "Rent Now" button with a date picker and a button to submit a booking request.

    2. Implement Reviews and Ratings:

        Problem: There's no trust or feedback system.

        Solution:

            Backend: Create endpoints to allow a user to leave a review and a rating for an item after a completed booking.

            Frontend: Display the average rating on product cards and a list of reviews on the item detail page.

Phase 3: Security & Production Readiness

These steps are critical for making your application secure, robust, and ready for the public.

    1. JWT-Based Authentication:

        Problem: The current login system is basic. A stateless, token-based approach is more scalable and secure for modern APIs.

        Solution:

            Backend: Modify your /api/login endpoint to return a JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful login. For all protected endpoints (like creating or editing an item), require this token to be sent in the request headers for authorization.

            Frontend: Store the received JWT securely (e.g., in an HttpOnly cookie or local storage) and send it with every subsequent authenticated API request.

    2. Advanced Authorization:

        Problem: The backend logic for permissions is not fully fleshed out (e.g., can anyone update any item?).

        Solution: Implement strict checks on the backend. Before updating or deleting an item, verify that the owner_id of the item matches the ID of the user making the request (extracted from their JWT).

    3. Environment Variables for Secrets:

        Problem: Database credentials and other secrets might be visible in your docker-compose.yml file.

        Solution: Move all secrets (database passwords, secret keys for JWTs) into a .env file and update your docker-compose.yml to read from it. The .env file should never be committed to version control.

Phase 4: Deployment to a Live Server

This is the final phase of getting your application on the internet.

    1. Choose a Cloud Provider:

        Select a platform like DigitalOcean, AWS, or Google Cloud.

    2. Use a Managed Database:

        In production, it's highly recommended to use a managed database service (e.g., Amazon RDS, DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL) instead of running your database in a Docker container. They are more reliable, scalable, and handle backups automatically.

    3. Production Dockerfiles:

        Create separate Dockerfile.prod files for your frontend and backend.

            Frontend: The production Dockerfile should build your React app into static HTML/CSS/JS files and serve them using a lightweight web server like Nginx.

            Backend: Your production Gunicorn setup should be optimized for performance.

    4. Set Up HTTPS:

        Your live site must be served over HTTPS for security. You can get a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.

    5. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):

        For a truly professional workflow, set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like GitHub Actions. This can automate the process of testing and deploying your code to the live server every time you push a change to your main branch.
